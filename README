Text/NumericList version 0.01
=============================

This module converts strings into arrays of positive integers and
vice-versa.  Sequential integers in the input array are replaced by a
range in the output string.  This is best illustrated by an example.

 ===================================================
 Input string	Resulting array	    Resulting string	    
 ---------------------------------------------------
 '3,2,1,3,5-7'	1,2,3,5,6,7	    '1-3,5-7'
 ===================================================

Output array is always sorted and unique.  Text::NumericList module is
useful for applications where a user is required to enter large arrays
of integers.  For example, instead of making the user select 50
check-boxes or list 50 numbers, the user can just type '1-50' in a
text input field.
